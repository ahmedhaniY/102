## Choosing a text editor

Now a text editor is a program you use in order to write your code in, this is purely a personal choice. You can use the default Text editor like note pad.

But its recommended to use other softwares that have helpful feautres like:

- Code completion
  - Closes opened tags, suggests variables like the autocompletion in phone
- Syntax highlighting
  - Gives each group a color, like tags/variables/commands
- Themes
  - Have a range of themes that help you visually and asthetically
- Extensions
  - Offer a variety of extensions that eases the work
  
I personally liked [atom](https://atom.io/) for its dark theme and autocompletion.


## CLI commands

Unlike Graphical operating systems like OS, ubnutu uses command lines in order to interact with the computer, this means its harder, but it gives you more control than before.

command | function
------- | --------
cd| change directiries
mkdir| make folder
touch| make file
pwd| know current location
ls| list files in folder
sudo| to use root user
