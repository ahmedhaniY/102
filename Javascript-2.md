# JavaScript

## Logical Operators

Touched upon briefly in the previous notes, operators are a vital part of the standard javascript file, as they are considered one of the most used tools that we can compare data with and create statments as well. Now they have many uses, and these are some of them:

Operators | Usage
--------- | -----
'+' | Add
'-' | Subtract
'*' | Multiply
'/' | Divide
==  | equals
=== | strict equal
!=  | doesn't equal
!== | strict does't equal


## Loops

Loops are important as they can do the same task over and over as long as a certain condition is true, now you can use **For** **While** and **Do...while**, they all have a condition in common and the same format
for (i=0;i<10;i++) {*code*}
