# Markdown

**Markdown** is an easy way to style and organize text on the web. Unlike HTML its quicker to author, and easier to learn. You can manipulate text in many ways, such as making it **bold**, *italic* and many more. As well as being able to add pictures and lists.

### Headers

Just like HTML, Markdown gives you the ability to choose from presets for headers by using hashtags (#). 
Using one # gives the largest header, and ## gives a smaller one, and so on till six hashtags #######.
```
# is like <h1>
## is like <h2>
...
####### is like <h6>
```


### Text

You can make text bold and italic, and even combine between them both.


#### Bold

In order to make text **bold** you need to put it between two stars on each side like this : `**text**`

#### *Italic*

In order to make text *italic* you need to put it between one star on each side like this : `*text*`

#### *Italic and Bold*

You can combine both ***Italic and bold*** by using the same method as before : `***text***`


### Links and Images

Markdown allows you to link images and URLs as well.

#### Images <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Yin_yang.svg/768px-Yin_yang.svg.png" alt="Yinyang" width="50"/>
In order to embed an image, you need to use the following format: `![Alt Text](url)` 

#### Links
