# Computers secrets

In this page, I will be noting down my summary of some great videos by code.org about how the computers work. From this playlist I chose What Makes a Computer, a Computer? , Binary & Data

### What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

Computers are everywhere, earphones laptops consoles smart watches, all of them have something in common, they all need the following:

- Input
    - What we give the computer from the outer world
- Storage
    - Keep the information from input in storage
- Processing
    - Process that information
- Output
    - Give the processed information back to the outerworld


### Binary & Data

Wires and circuits carry all the information in a computer, they store it using electricity, turning it on and off represents 0 and 1, which is the binary system. Decimal has 0-9, binary has only 0 and 1. Any number and any letter can be stored using binary. 

Images are made of pixels that can be represented with colors
Videos are made of many images
Audio is made out of waves that can also be represented with numbers.

### Circuits & Logic

Circuits are used to combine the input data to process them into output. Circuits have many types like And which needs both inputs to be 1 in order to give 1, or nand which gives the opposite of and, and or, nor xor and many more.

You can also use mutliple curcuits to combine data and make a calculator, millions of curcuits exist witihn a computer to process the information.
