## Choosing a text editor

But its recommended to use other softwares that have helpful feautres like:
-Code completion
  -Closes opened tags, suggests variables like the autocompletion in phone
-Syntax highlighting
  -Gives each group a color, like tags/variables/commands
-Themes
  -Have a range of themes that help you visually and asthetically
