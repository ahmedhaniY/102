# Git Intro

## Version control

When working on a project, many versions are created, each containing their own edits, removals and additions. Instead of having multiple files with different names, version control allows taking snapshots of the code at different stages with the changes occuring. Allowing the user to access different versions and seeing what modifications happened.

### Development of Version Control

* Since projects have teams working on them, the need for way to be able to work at the same time emerged, which lead to the creation of Local Version Control Systems. Local VCS had the the data be stored on a physical hard disk.

* The next stage of VCS was the centralized system, where the data was stored on a single server that can be accessed by several clients, allowing the team members to be working on the same project at the same time.

* Following the Centralized VCS, the distributed systems came. Programmmers all fear losing their work from a failure or an error in the system, which is what the distrubted system solves. Many backups are created to be saved on different servers.

## Git

Back in 2005, there was a feud between Linux and the company behind the DVCS they were using, so Linus the founder of Linux started working on his own DVCS, called Git. And since then, Git became one of the most used systems around the world.

Git is used to make the flow of work easier and safer for the users. As it takes snapshots of the different versions of the files within a repositary.
