# Welcome to Ahmad's reading notes

In this page, I will be noting down my journey learning markdown in github. I hope you find this pleasent to read and easy to follow.

## Markdown

**Markdown** is an easy way to style and organize text on the web. Unlike HTML its quicker to author, and easier to learn. You can manipulate text in many ways, such as making it **bold**, *italic* and many more. As well as being able to add pictures and lists.

#### Bold

In order to make text bold you need to put it between two stars on each side like this : `**text**`

#### *Italic*

In order to make text italic you need to put it between one star on each side like this : `*text*`

#### *Italic and Bold*

You can combine both ***Italic and bold*** by using the same method as before : `***text***'
