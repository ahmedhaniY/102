# CSS

Since HTML is the skeleton of the webpage body, CSS can be considered as the skin of that body. CSS is used to present and make the webpage look better and nicer, this includes colors, backgrounds, fonts, allinging and many more. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet, and it normally exists as a seperate file ith a .css extension, but can also exist within the HTML file but that is a bad practice.

## Format

In CSS you can create a class like `.blue` or target an element in the whole page `p ` or elements within a certain parent `nav p` and you can use commands to change many things like border, padding, margin and color

### Colors

Many ways exist in CSS to specify the color, you can use hixdecimal #fffff, or Red Green Blue (RGB), Or HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness, and finally some colors exist as their names like red and orange and others.
