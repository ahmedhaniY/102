# Growth Mindset

Many people make the mistake of thinking success is bound by your IQ or your existing talents, when infact its about growth. But what does that mean? and what is the difference between a growth mindset and a fixed one? Well, to be a person with a growth mindset means to believe in improving and hardwork, and knowing that in order to reach your goal, you need to be **persistent** and not give up easily.
